#Following are my steps

##Add Bootstrap and Sass to Ember.js App

Let’s add some basic styling to our application. We use Bootstrap with Sass. Ember CLI can install for us add-ons and useful packages. These add-ons simplify our development process, because we don’t have to reinvent the wheel, we get more out of the box. You can find various packages, add-ons on these websites: http://www.emberaddons.com or http://www.emberobserver.com

We install an add-on for Sass and another for Bootstrap.


Run the following two commands:

* $ ember install ember-cli-sass
* $ ember install ember-cli-bootstrap-sassy

* You will see, that your ./package.json is extended with a couple of lines.

* Rename your app.css to app.scss with the following terminal command or you can use your editor to rename the ./app/styles/app.css file:

* $ mv app/styles/app.css app/styles/app.scss

Open ./app/styles/app.scss file in your editor and add the following line:

* @import "bootstrap";
